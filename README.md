<strong>Student Performance Evaluator Project</strong>

Implemented a Student Performance Evaluator using machine learning algorithms like AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingRegressor, and RandomForestRegressor. The system accurately predicts student performance based on relevant features, enabling educators to identify struggling students early for timely interventions.

<strong>Key Features:</strong>

<strong>Multiple Algorithms:</strong> Leveraged AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingRegressor, and RandomForestRegressor to build predictive models for student performance evaluation, achieving high accuracy and robustness.

<strong>Modular Coding:</strong> Adopted a modular coding approach for enhanced maintainability and scalability. The project was organized into reusable components, improving code readability and facilitating future enhancements.

<strong>End-to-End Data Pipeline:</strong> Established an end-to-end data pipeline for efficient data preprocessing and feature engineering. The pipeline optimized data transformation and handled missing values, ensuring high-quality input for the models.

<strong>Logging and Exception Handling:</strong> Implemented a comprehensive logging system to track model training progress and monitor performance. Additionally, incorporated robust exception handling to ensure smooth execution and minimize runtime errors.
